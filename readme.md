# Text Savvy

by [Nerdy Nomads](https://github.com/NerdyNomads)

Hello, we are Nerdy Nomads, a group of 5 student developers hoping to help fellow academics in this new age of digital information.  More and more people use the web to collect data, whether through a form of researching, studying or reading. There is vast information out there, but how can we keep track of them in an organized and efficient manner? Text Savvy is a browser extension tool to help with this. With a simple highlight and right-click, it allows users to save text on the go. It provides the ability to organize information through workspaces and share with other users. We value productivity, efficiency and collaboration. We believe that with the integration of Text Savvy into your workflow will make your flow as seamless as possible.

## Objective

Users will be able to save text located within another website, simply by highlighting the text and saving it through the browser extension. Along with the text, the extension will also save the source of the text (URL) so that users can easily revisit it. Workspaces can be created so that a user will be able to organize their collection of texts. These workspaces can also be shared between multiple users.

## Core Features in Progress

1. **Account Creation and Management** - Users will be able to create an account that their text will be linked to. This will allow users to visit their workspace with any device.

2. **Create a Workspace** - This will allow users to create different work spaces where different related blocks of text can be grouped together.

3. **Share Workspaces with Others** - This application will be able to share the workspaces with others for collaboration. This will include different levels of access (e.g. Read access only, Contributor).

4. **Highlight and Save Text** - Users will be able to highlight some text blocks on the screen, and right click to bring up a menu to save the text.

5. **Browser Extension** - This will include a simplified version of the key features from the web application (e.g., save texts, sign-in/log out, settings, create/select workspace, home button linked to web page).

6. **Non-functional Feature** - This application will respond to 1000 user requests across 100 accounts per minute concurrently.
